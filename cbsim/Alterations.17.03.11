Summary of current setup
Hemispheres are placed as cbsim with 0.05cm airgap each and 0.076cm iron. There is no gap then between the iron and the crystals. The 0.05cm was set in a ffcards initialisiation file and is read as the variable gap in the ugeom.f code. Need to add the runtime variability. Done. Gap made also for tunnel, skirting, crystals, inner can. Sergey reports he uses 0.4cm as the airgap!
The cut crystal region in cbsim is defined by the volume CCTT (used to place the tunnels into, there is one for each hemisphere), it has radius 10.3cm +1/16inch(steel), a tube of this radius is used to cut the crystals in G4. In Sergey's new geometry this volume is moved and the single CCUT volume is used to place the tunnel into. This volume is now also responsible for the cut crystals, but has a reduced diameter of 8.95 cm (radtun, based on CB angle 24 degrees (was 28)and inner radius 22cm (8.7inches))), this effectively does not cut any crystals. What cut volume radius should I use for G4? 
Tunnel length has gone from 11cm to 8cm. Inner radius 8.95 compared to 10.3cm.
One variation to Sergeys new geometry is with the RIMS, move them into the CB exit cut (at 40cm) cut outer angle from 30 degrees to 21 degrees, this volume has to fit into the exit region, 30 deg seems too big.
