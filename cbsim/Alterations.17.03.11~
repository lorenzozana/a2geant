Summary of current setup
Hemispheres are placed as cbsim with 0.05cm airgap each and 0.076cm iron. There is no gap then between the iron and the crystals. The 0.05cm was set in a ffcards iniitialisiation file and is read as the variable gap in the ugeom.f code. Need to add the runtime variability 
The cut crystal region in cbsim is defined by the volume CCTT (used to place the tunnels into, there is one for each hemisphere), it has radius 10.3cm +1/16inch(steel), a tube of this radius is used to cut the crystals in G4. In Sergey's new geometry this volume is moved and the single CCUT volume is used to place the tunnel into. This volume is now also responsible for the cut crystals, but has a reduced diameter of 8.95 cm, this effectively does not cut any crystals. What cut volume radius should I use for G4?
